# SWT

The Spatial Wavelet Transform of J. K. Hillier (2008) Seamount detection and isolation with a modified wavelet transform. /Basin Research/ 20, 555-573. https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2117.2008.00382.x

## Compilation

A Makefile is provided to compile the code on Unix systems. Download
the code repository and run `make` from the `SWT/` directory. Two
executables will be produced:

- `swt`: computes the spatial wavelet transform on a provided profile
- `find_seamounts`: estimates seamount morphology from depth profiles filtered by `swt`

## Usage

See the Makefile for usage examples.

## Testing

Snapshot characterization tests are implemented using an example
provided by Yuezhi Zhong. Run

```
make check
```

from the `SWT/` directory to run the tests. The input data is run
through the executables and then compared to output that has
previously been generated by the program. Any discrepancies will cause
this program to fail with a nonzero exit code and to print out the
mismatched data.
